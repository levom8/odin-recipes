This project will test my basic HTML skills such as referring to the proper DOCTYPE, using html tag to designate the root, the head tag to incorporate all elements that can't be seen by users but render the website better, the body tag to incorporate all elements to be seen by users. 
Will also create list and use <a>, <img> tags to add links and images
